I developed and deployed PLC and HMI applications across oil & gas facilities in Ecuador, California, and Texas, designing control logic from detailed philosophy documents and integrating equipment and sensors for real-time SCADA monitoring. I also collaborated on the migration of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) from legacy to modern PLC platforms to boost safety and reliability, and provided routine SCADA/HMI maintenance to ensure maximum uptime.
