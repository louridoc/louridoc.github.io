Work experience
======
* <b>Video Engineering Team Intern</b> at [<b>Apple Inc.</b>](http://www.apple.com/), Sunnyvale, California - May 2022 to August 2022
  * Designed a real-time image-degradation detector for the Vision Pro headset’s camera feed, leveraging a 3D-CNN architecture to support tracking accuracy.
  * Developed an end-to-end data pipeline: curated and annotated a large-scale video dataset, automated preprocessing and augmentation using Python (PyTorch + OpenCV).


* <b>Automation Engineer</b> at [<b>Applied Control Engineering</b>](https://www.ace-net.com/), Newark-Delaware - March 2020 to July 2020
  * Streamlined testing procedures for critical control loops and Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), enhancing operational reliability in a chemical plant.
  * Executed comprehensive HMI display upgrades from Simatic WinCC Step7 to ABB 800xA across multiple facilities, improving user interface and system efficiency.


* <b>Founder & CEO</b> at <b>Heroeng Cía. Ltda.</b>, Quito-Ecuador - June 2015 to October 2023
  * Developed a proprietary method for repairing mechanical seals exposed to highly corrosive formation water, directly reducing client M&R (Maintenance & Repair) costs.
  * Delivered a compelling value proposition, offering effective seal repairs at a fraction of the cost of a new part, which allowed clients to save significantly on operational expenses.
  * Directed all business operations, including client acquisition, P&L (Profit & Loss) management, technical service delivery, and strategic vision for the company's entire 8-year lifecycle.


* <b>Automation Engineer</b> at [<b>Proyectos Integrales del Ecuador PIL S.A.</b>](http://pilautomation.com/), Quito-Ecuador - May 2013 to June 2015
  * Developed and deployed Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) applications for oil & gas facilities in Ecuador, California, and Texas.
  * Worked on the migration of critical Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) from legacy to modern PLC platforms for a major facility, significantly enhancing system safety and reliability. (link)
  * Designed PLC control logic based on detailed control philosophy documents and cause-and-effect matrices.
  * Integrated equipment with PLCs using the Modbus protocol, enabling real-time data monitoring and control from a central SCADA system.
  * Performed routine maintenance and support for SCADA/HMI systems to ensure high uptime.


* <b>Project Coordinator</b> at [<b>ASTAP Cía. Ltda.</b>](https://www.astap.com/), Quito-Ecuador - Jan 2012 to Oct 2012
  * Successfully managed a high-stakes project to replace and repair a hydrogen reciprocating compressor, vital to refinery operations.
  *	Ensured seamless project execution by coordinating all phases, including foundation, mechanical parts supply, sensor systems, and operational readiness tests.
  *	Led personnel and staffing logistics, effectively deploying teams to meet project milestones.
  *	Bridged the language gap by accurately translating technical engineering manuals from English to Spanish, which was critical for correct installation and operation.
