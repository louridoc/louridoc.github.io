title: "A COVID-19 emergency response for remote control of a dialysis machine with mobile HRI"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper introduces a non-invasive remote monitoring and control system that retrofits dialysis machines with robotic manipulators, allowing healthcare workers to operate touchscreens via a live-streamed tablet or desktop interface. An accuracy evaluation and comparative user studies of touch- versus click-based modes showed similar low task loads and usability—with click interactions yielding more consistent performance—leading to proposed refinements that enhance visual fidelity and user experience.'
