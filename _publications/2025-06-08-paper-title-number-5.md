excerpt: 'In this paper we introduce a VR-based rehabilitation system that models a user’s upper‐limb kinematics to generate personalized “capability maps,” enabling tailored, game‐like therapy programs. By adapting exercises to each patient’s physical limitations—and emphasizing specific joint usage—the platform both engages users and objectively tracks their progress over time.'
