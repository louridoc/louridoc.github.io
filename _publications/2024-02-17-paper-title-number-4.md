excerpt: 'In this paper we present a weeklong professional development workshop that combines social‐capital and cultural‐historical activity (CHAT) theories with project‐based (PBL) and 5E instructional models, using a low-cost 3D-printed exoskeleton kit to help robotics researchers craft implementable training materials for occupational therapists. Through hands-on assembly, capability mapping, and structured mentor–protégé interactions, participants learn to translate technical research into accessible, practice-oriented recommendations'
